## Q1

-Objections that still carry some weight:
One objection that still carries weight is the concern about whether passing the Turing Test truly signifies intelligence or just mimicking human behavior. Another objection is the issue of understanding and consciousness, which some argue are necessary components of true intelligence.

-Refutations being still valid:
Turing's refutations are valid to a large extent. He addresses objections such as "machines can't think" by arguing that defining "thinking" in a way that excludes machines is problematic. His refutations provide strong reasoning but may not fully satisfy everyone.

-New objections:
Yes, new objections have arisen due to advancements such as deep learning. One objection is the lack of transparency and interpretability in AI systems, which raises concerns about accountability and bias. Additionally, the potential for AI to outperform humans in specific tasks without possessing true understanding remains a significant point of contention.

-Turing's prediction being reasonable:
Turing's prediction was overly optimistic. By 2000, computers had made significant progress in various tasks, but passing the Turing Test with unskilled interrogators proved to be much more challenging than anticipated. While AI has made remarkable advancements, achieving human-like conversation and understanding remains elusive.

## Q2
1) Playing a decent game of ping pong:
Answer= Yes!, the task can be achieved by computers but with limitations as we can fit a robot arm with a pingpong paddle and motion sensors in order to move the paddle where the ball is, however the limitations occurs in achieving the human level-performance as the fast paced nature of the game , coupled with the need for real-time decision making causes significant challenges for current AI
2) Driving in the center of Karachi:
Answer= The above task can be solved by the computer as although advancements in self driving technology such as tesla’s self-driving cars demonstrate the feasibility of driving without human intervention, driving in the center of Karachi presents some unique challenges . The traffic is not organized, unpredictable traffic patterns, varied road conditions and most citizens do not follow traffic rules such as stopping on red light and changing lanes without indicators while equipping vehicles with numerous sensors can help address some of the above mentioned challenges, achieving seamless driving in Karachi’s traffic is a challenge for current AI 
5) Writing an intentionally funny story:
Answer= The above task cannot be solved by the computer because generating funny stories requires deep understanding of humor , context and human emotions which AI currently struggle to achieve , so this is the challenge for computers currently 
6) Giving competent legal advice in a specialized area of law:
Answer = Computers cannot solve the above problem currently as computers face significant challenges in providing competent legal advice in specialized areas of law as they require deep understanding of case specifics and legal nuances . While computers excel at quantative analysis, qualitative judgements that consider context and human factors are difficult for them to accurately assess
7) Translating Spoken English into spoken urdu in real time:
Answer = Yes, computers can currently perform real time translation, because of natural language processing and machine translation technology. Google translate is a great example for this 


## Q3

Domain: “Online Customer Support Chabots”

Environment Description:

● Accessible: The environment is accessible, meaning the agent can observe and interact with it through a digital interface.

● Deterministic: Responses from users and system actions have clear outcomes, making the environment deterministic.

● Episodic: Each interaction with a user constitutes an episode, as they are discrete and independent of each other.

● Static: The environment remains relatively stable during interactions, with no significant changes occurring outside of user inputs
and system responses.

● Discrete: Interactions with users occur in discrete messages or exchanges rather than continuous streams of data.

Agent Architecture: 
For this domain, an agent architecture based on a combination of rule-based and machine-learning approaches would be most suitable. This hybrid architecture allows the agent to leverage predefined rules for common scenarios while also learning from data to handle more complex or novel situations effectively. The agent should also incorporate natural language processing (NLP) capabilities to understand and generate human-like responses in text-based conversations. Additionally, reinforcement learning techniques could be employed to continuously improve the agent's performance over time based on user feedback and interaction outcomes.

## Q5
Q5)
1) True, as for an agent to be perfectly rational , It requires the complete knowledge of the environment , so the agent with limited may make less optimal decisions as it lacks the full understanding of the situation.
For example: A self-driving car in a heavy rain or fog woth limited sensor visibility can cause the car to miss obstacles or road signs , leading to suboptimal driving decisions

2)	True as pure reflex agents act on the current percept, without considering past or future states.
In environment where actions depend on a sequence of events or involve strategic thinking, these agents may exhibit irrational behaviors.

3)	False, as in certain environments, achieving perfect rationality for any agent may be unattainable because of complexity, uncertainty or conflicting objectives.                                                                    For example: a rapidly changing stock market environment where there are unpredictable fluctuations and multiple competing interests, it may be difficult for any agent to behave perfectly  rationally due to complex factors influencing the market                                                                                                                   

4)	False, as input to an agent program includes the percept which is input from environments where as the agent function takes the input and process it to produce actions.                                             For Example: in chess playing agent, input is the current state of chess board and the previous moves played and agent function provides the next step to play 

5)	True, as if all available actions offer the same expected utility, adapting a strategy of randomly selecting an action can be considered rational.                                                                                            For example: in a game where all possible moves yield identical outcomes and opponent strategy  remains unknown , option for random selection prevents the agents from being vulnerable to exploitable patterns
