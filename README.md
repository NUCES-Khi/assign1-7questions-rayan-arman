## Q1

-Objections that still carry some weight:
One objection that still carries weight is the concern about whether passing the Turing Test truly signifies intelligence or just mimicking human behavior. Another objection is the issue of understanding and consciousness, which some argue are necessary components of true intelligence.

-Refutations being still valid:
Turing's refutations are valid to a large extent. He addresses objections such as "machines can't think" by arguing that defining "thinking" in a way that excludes machines is problematic. His refutations provide strong reasoning but may not fully satisfy everyone.

-New objections:
Yes, new objections have arisen due to advancements such as deep learning. One objection is the lack of transparency and interpretability in AI systems, which raises concerns about accountability and bias. Additionally, the potential for AI to outperform humans in specific tasks without possessing true understanding remains a significant point of contention.

-Turing's prediction being reasonable:
Turing's prediction was overly optimistic. By 2000, computers had made significant progress in various tasks, but passing the Turing Test with unskilled interrogators proved to be much more challenging than anticipated. While AI has made remarkable advancements, achieving human-like conversation and understanding remains elusive.

## Q3

Domain: “Online Customer Support Chabots”

Environment Description:
● Accessible: The environment is accessible, meaning the agent can observe and interact with it through a digital interface.
● Deterministic: Responses from users and system actions have clear outcomes, making the environment deterministic.
● Episodic: Each interaction with a user constitutes an episode, as they are discrete and independent of each other.
● Static: The environment remains relatively stable during interactions, with no significant changes occurring outside of user inputs and system responses.
● Discrete: Interactions with users occur in discrete messages or exchanges rather than continuous streams of data.

Agent Architecture: 
For this domain, an agent architecture based on a combination of rule-based and machine-learning approaches would be most suitable. This hybrid architecture allows the agent to leverage predefined rules for common scenarios while also learning from data to handle more complex or novel situations effectively. The agent should also incorporate natural language processing (NLP) capabilities to understand and generate human-like responses in text-based conversations. Additionally, reinforcement learning techniques could be employed to continuously improve the agent's performance over time based on user feedback and interaction outcomes.
